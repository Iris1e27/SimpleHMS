## Program design
- Use java and mysql.
- For the reasonable screening of most illegal input, the code uses 
a large number of doâ€¦while statements. 
- Design 2 classes: staff and guest, when you login with one 
identity the system will create a real object to do.
- Design 2 classes: chef and room to operate database so that 
main() function only focus on the real logic.
- Clear instructions, detailed logical steps and helpful user manual.
